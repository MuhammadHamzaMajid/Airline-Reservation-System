Note: The database was 'created' in Postgres using pgadmin4 built-in function.
So, the SQL command for CREATE database is not present in the SQL file.

We have seven tables in total:
1. Passengers
2. Cities
3. Payments
4. Seat_Classes
5. Flights
6. Seats
7. Reservations

In the end of the SQL file, there are functions given to view the information joining the above tables
in different combinations, and also the CRUD + other practical stored procedures.

For the ERD and DFD, they were bigger than the screen. So instead of taking pictures, I uploaded the draw.io files.


Relationships b/w the Tables:

One-to-Many:
Cities -> Flights (origin)
Cities -> Flights (destination)
Passengers -> Payments
Passengers -> Reservations
Seat_Classes -> Seats
Flights -> Seats
Flights -> Reservations

Many-to-One:
Flights -> Cities (origin)
Flights -> Cities (destination)
Payments -> Passengers
Reservations -> Passengers
Seats -> Seat_Classes
Seats -> Flights
Reservations -> Flights

One-to-One:
Reservations -> Payments
Reservations -> Seats

Composite-key Relationships:
Flights -> Seats (multi-column)
Reservations -> Seats (multi-column)
